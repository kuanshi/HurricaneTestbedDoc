Bugs & Feature Requests
***************************
If you find bugs, have feature requests, or questions about how to install or use the application please post on the `messageBoard <https://simcenter-messageboard.designsafe-ci.org/smf/index.php?board=17.0>`_. 

To avoid duplication try the `Search` feature before creating a `New Topic`. When creating a `New Topic` to report a bug or new feature request it would be helpful if you could place in the `Subject` area, as shown in :numref:`figBugReport`, an indication of what the post is about:

   #. **BUG**, for bugs, i.e. BUG: Program crashes when starting or during usage
   #. **FEATURE**, for new feature requests, i.e. FEATURE: Incorporate support to import mesh from a particular software
