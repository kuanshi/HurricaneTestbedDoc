The Water-borne Natural Hazards with Uncertainty Quantification Application (Hydro-UQ app) is an open-source research application that can be used to predict the response of a building / a community subjected to events like tsunami and storm-surge. The application is focused on quantifying the uncertainties in the predicted response, given the that the uncertainties in models, loads, and analysis. The computations are performed in a workflow application that will run on a high performance computer made available by |DesignSafe|.

This document covers the features and capabilities of the ``version 1.0`` of the Hydro-UQ tool. Users are encouraged to comment on what additional features and capabilities they would like to see in future versions of the application through the `Message Board <https://simcenter-messageboard.designsafe-ci.org/smf/index.php?board=17.0>`_.
