StEER Set Results
==================

For the Hurricane Laura, the StEER has released the report of the visual inspection and damage estimation 
for sample buildings in Lake Charles (refered as StEER buildings). There are 99 StEER buildings also 
included in this testbed, which offers an opportunity to validate the workflow. In the meantime, the relatively 
small sample size also offers the convenience of investigating the influence of different modeling parameters 
on the estimated damage states and related them to corresponding field observations to help understand the 
dominant trends in the data. As will be illustrated, some of these trends validate the effectiveness of the 
methodology and others indicate potential measures to improve the wind resistance.

:numref:`influential_var` plots the estimated damage states against key building attributes that are found
to influence the resulting damage state under the hurricane wind hazard. Major obsered trends are as follows:

#. In general, the damage state is negatively correlated to the year built. Buildings with built year after 2000 
   are found to have prominant improvement in the wind resistance and have lower damage states. This is reasoned 
   by the authors to be led by the assumption in the ruleset that the post-2000 buildings would have shutter 
   measures and stronger roof deck attachment.
#. The surface roughness, i.e., terrain feature, is found to be a key variable when considering the potential 
   damage from the hurricane to the building. Even moving from open terrain to light suburban, following the 
   damage fuctions in HAZUS, we see about 50% reduction in the average damage state.
#. Shutters could significantly help reduce the potential wind-induced damage: average damage state is reduced 
   from 2.2 to 1.2
#. Garage type also would influence the building performance against the wind hazard: garages per SFBC 1994 are 
   found to have much better behaviors than the standard and wake garages.
#. Roof deck attachement using a tighter nail spacing (6 in vs. 12 in) is found to perform much better.
#. Gable roof is found to have slightly worse performance than the hip and flat roofs.

   Influential building attributes on the wind-induced damage state.

It is noted that the trends observed in :numref:`influential_var` is based on a so-called "median" model representing 
our best estimates of building attributes. However, in reality, because of the lack of high-resolution or multiple 
data resources, we may not have 100% confidence about certain building attributes or hazard fields, e.g., year built 
or peak wind speed at a specific site. Hence, the esimated "median" damage state from the "median: model may not give 
the full representation of the real damage potential.  As illustrated in :numref:`ds_uq`, if considering the uncertainty 
in the year built (instead of a deterministic value, asssuming it follows a normal distribution with a standard devidation 
of 10 years), we could sample year built from the distribution and repeat the damage assessment by sufficient times to 
estimated the distrbution of damage state.

   Uncertainty in the estimated damage state.

Following this idea, for each of the 99 StEER buildings, we sampled 100 year built from a distribution with the mean of 
the given year built value and a standard deviation of 10 years and run the damage assessment for each sampled case.
:numref:`ds_uq_yb` summarizes the comparison between the mean and 95-precentile of estimated damage state and the 
StEER damage state. Similar exercises (:numref:`ds_uq_pws`) are conducted for the peak wind speed where we sampled 100 PWS from a disribution 
with a standard deviation of 20 mph.
