Regional Results (NSI-Based Year Built)
========================================

The geospatial distribution of estimated wind damage states and losses under Hurricane Laura
are shown in :numref:`dl_and_cdf_lc` (a) and (b), respectively. Referring to :numref:`dl_and_cdf_lc` (c), most of the buildings 
in the studied region (85%) have relatively low to moderate damage (expected Damage State less than 2.0) 
due to the wind hazard. Referring to :numref:`dl_and_cdf_lc` (c), about 20% buildings would expected damage states lower than 
DS-1 and only about 5% buildings would expect to have damage states exceeding DS-3. 
The CDF of resulting loss ratios is shown in :numref:`dl_and_cdf_lc` (d) where about 40% buildings would expect 
a loss less than 10% of the total reconstruction cost, and about 30% buildings could see a loss more than 20% of the total 
reconstruction cost.
