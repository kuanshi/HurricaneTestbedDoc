Regional Results (NSI-Based Year Built)
========================================

The geospatial distribution of estimated wind damage states and losses under the Hurricane Laura
are shown in :numref:`dl_and_cdf` (a) and :numref:`dl_and_cdf` (b), respectively. Referring  to :numref:`dl_and_cdf` (c), most of the buildings 
in the studied region (85%) have relatively low and moderate damage (expected Damage State less than 2.0) 
due to the wind hazard. Referring to :numref:`pds_cdf`, about 20% buildings would have 50% or higher probability of 
exceeding Damage State 2, and about 5% buildings would have 50% or higher chance of exceeding Damage State 3. 
The CDF of resulting loss ratios is shown in :numref:`dl_and_cdf` (d) where about 40% buildings would expect 
a loss less than 10% of the reconstruction cost, and about 30% buildings could see a loss more than 20% of the total 
reconstruction cost. The following sections will present comparative, sensitivity, and validation studies to investigate potential influences of important building attributes (e.g., year built) and 
and compare the results to available damage assessment datasets from StEER and FEMA.

SURF-Zillow Year Built Results
=============================

As discussed in :ref:`lbl-testbed_LC_asset_description`, the National Structural Inventory (NSI) is used for 
deriving the year built formation. Because not all buildings in the testbed inventory can be mapped exactly to 
the NSI dataset, `SURF <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/SURF>`_ is employed to construct and train a neural 
network and used it to predict year built information based on the spatial patterns in the NSI dataset.

In parallel to this exploration, `Zillow <https://www.zillow.com/>`_ also provides the year built information for 
many of the residual buildings in the studied region.

Similar to the implementation of NSI dataset, the 1182 data points of year built from Zillow are used to train a 
neural network, :numref:`surf_yb_test` shows the verification of the trained neural network (predicted vs. true values,
Zillow dataset). More than :math:`85%` buildings have prediction errors less than 20 years.

   SURF-predicted vs. original year built from Zillow dataset.

The neural network is used to predict the year built information for the entire Lake Charles inventory. :numref:`surf_yb_comp`
contrast the resulting SURF-Zillow and the SURF-NSI year built spatial distribution. The difference in year built is relatively 
small for the downtown buildings (~1960s) but increases at the bounds with a maximum of 80 years. The year built information 
from SURF-Zillow dataset is used for an extra round of simulation, the spatial distribution of damage states of SURF-Zillow set 
is shown in :numref:`ds_zillow_comp` and contrasted against the SURF-NSI result (:numref:`dl_1`). Note that the difference is not 
prominent in the downtown Lake Charles. The major spot of divergent results are seen in southwest of the city where the SURF-Zillow set 
predicts relatively lower damage states. Provided in :numref:`pds_cdf` are the CDF distributions of probability of exceeding DS-2 
and DS-3.

Validation: StEER
==================

For the Hurricane Laura, the StEER has released the report of the visual inspection and damage estimation 
for sample buildings in Lake Charles (refereed as StEER buildings). There are 99 StEER buildings also 
included in this testbed, which offers an opportunity to validate the workflow. In the meantime, the relatively 
small sample size also offers the convenience of investigating the influence of different modeling parameters 
on the estimated damage states and related them to corresponding field observations to help understand the 
dominant trends in the data. As will be illustrated, some of these trends validate the effectiveness of the 
methodology and others indicate potential measures to improve the wind resistance.

:numref:`influential_var` plots the estimated damage states against key building attributes that are found
to influence the resulting damage state under the hurricane wind hazard. Major observed trends are as follows:

#. In general, the damage state is negatively correlated to the year built. Buildings with built year after 2000 
   are found to have prominent improvement in the wind resistance and have lower damage states. This is reasoned 
   by the authors to be led by the assumption in the ruleset that the post-2000 buildings would have shutter 
   measures and stronger roof deck attachment.
#. The surface roughness, i.e., terrain feature, is found to be a key variable when considering the potential 
   damage from the hurricane to the building. Even moving from open terrain to light suburban, following the 
   damage functions in HAZUS, we see about 50% reduction in the average damage state.
#. Shutters could significantly help reduce the potential wind-induced damage: average damage state is reduced 
   from 2.2 to 1.2
#. Garage type also would influence the building performance against the wind hazard: garages per SFBC 1994 are 
   found to have much better behaviors than the standard and wake garages.
#. Roof deck attachment using a tighter nail spacing (6 in vs. 12 in) is found to perform much better.
#. Gable roof is found to have slightly worse performance than the hip and flat roofs.

   Influential building attributes on the wind-induced damage state.

It is noted that the trends observed in :numref:`influential_var` is based on a so-called "median" model representing 
our best estimates of building attributes. However, in reality, because of the lack of high-resolution or multiple 
data resources, we may not have 100% confidence about certain building attributes or hazard fields, e.g., year built 
or peak wind speed at a specific site. Hence, the estimated "median" damage state from the "median: model may not give 
the full representation of the real damage potential.  As illustrated in :numref:`ds_uq`, if considering the uncertainty 
in the year built (instead of a deterministic value, assuming it follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation 
of 10 years), we could sample year built from the distribution and repeat the damage assessment by sufficient times to 
estimated the distribution of damage state.

   Uncertainty in the estimated damage state.

Following this idea, for each of the 99 StEER buildings, we sampled 100 year built from a distribution with the mean of 
the given year built value and a standard deviation of 10 years and run the damage assessment for each sampled case.
:numref:`ds_uq_yb` summarizes the comparison between the mean and 95-percentile of estimated damage state and the 
StEER damage state. Similar exercises (:numref:`ds_uq_pws`) are conducted for the peak wind speed where we sampled 100 PWS from a 
distribution with a standard deviation of 20 mph.

Validation: FEMA Historical Geospatial Damage Assessment
========================================================

FEMA and the Department of Interior lead the development of the 
`Geospatial Platform <https://communities.geoplatform.gov/disasters/>`_, an internet-based service environment that 
provides a suite of well-manged geospatial data, services, applications, and tools. The 
`FEMA Historical Damage Assessment Database <https://communities.geoplatform.gov/disasters/historical-damage-assessment-database/>`_ 
is a repository of geospatial damage assessments from past National Disaster events where 
damage assessments were conducted either using high-resolution imagery or by means of geospatial modeling. 

For the Hurricane Laura, the damage categories of 112,571 buildings in the Louisiana were modeled from flood depths at the 
structure as characterized based on modeled wind, flood or surge data. Five damage categories are 
used: No Damage, Affected, Minor, Major, and Destroyed. Out of the 112,571 buildings, 573 buildings, located in 
the west bound of the Lake Charles city at the waterfront of the Prein Lake, are also investigated 
in this testbed. :numref:`fema_damage_subset` is a subset of data obtained from 
`FEMA Public Data <http://disasters.geoplatform.gov/publicdata/National/Data/HistoricalDamageAssessmentDatabase/PublicRelease_20210622/>`_.
:numref:`fema_damage_bim` is the building inventory for this subset.

:numref:`fema_dc` shows the damage categories collected from the FEMA Damage Assessment Database, where most buildings 
are in low damage levels, i.e., No Damage or Affected. Also noted from :numref:`fema_damage_subset` is that all these 
buildings are subject to CAT-4 gust wind speed, which is consistent with our input wind field where the 3-s gust peak 
wind speed is about 130 :math:`mph` (please see :ref:`lbl-testbed_LC_hazard_characterization`).

To compare these damage categories with the estimated damage states by the workflow in this testbed, we assume that the 
five damage categories are mapped to the five damage states in the HAZUS wind damage functions, assuming the inundation is 
not cause prominent flood-induced damage to the buildings. While this assumption is subjected to future validation, 
:numref:`fema_ds_comp` summarizes (1) the expected damage states of the 573 buildings, (2) the spatial distribution of difference between the FEMA 
Damage Categories and estimated damage states, and (3) the statistic distribution of the difference between the two.
Given the FEMA set is based on a discrete (category-based) description while the testbed set is based on probabilistic 
estimates, the two results have fairly good agreement except the FEMA set has buildings predicted as no damage (DS-0). 
This over-prediction of DS-0 is also seen in StEER set results (:numref:`ds_uq_yb` and :numref:`ds_uq_pws`). The uncertainty 
in the year built and wind speed, to some extent, can help explain this over-prediction. Future investigations are still 
needed to consider other possible factors causing this mismatch in predicted DS-0, e.g., the surface roughness (for these 573 buildings, 
the terrain inferred from LULC and used to determine the fragility function is "Open").
