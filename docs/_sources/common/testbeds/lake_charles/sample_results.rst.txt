Verification Results

This page summarizes sample results from the 
testbed runs with the focuses on verifying the estimated loss ratios by hand-calculations.

Building Inventory
===================

From the entire building inventory, 109 buildings (:numref:`sample_table`) are selected.
:numref:`scatter_matrix` shows the data distributions of the built year, surface
roughness (i.e., Terrain), roof shape, number of stories, and occupancy class.

Hand Calculation
==================

Hand calculations of wind loss are conducted using the
input building information and intensity measures for the sampled buildings.
:numref:`hand_calc` compares the hand-calculated loss ratios and the simulated
results which are in good agreement.
