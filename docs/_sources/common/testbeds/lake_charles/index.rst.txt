A number of members of the SimCenter Team assisted with this testbedâ€™s development and its documentation: 
Barbaros Cetiner, Adam Zsarnoczay, Kuanshi Zhong, Chaofeng Wang, Sascha Hornauer, and Wael Elhaddad. 
The testbed conceptualization was guided by Tracy Tracy Kijewski-Correa (University of Notre Dame), 
with implementation supervised by Frank McKenna (University of California Berkeley). 
Additional guidance was offered by Greg Deierlein (Stanford University), Andrew Kennedy 
(University of Notre Dame), and Matt Schoettler (University of California Berkeley). 

The Hazard Characterization leveraged models, software and simulations execuated by the following groups,
whose collaboration is greatly appreciated:

The wind fields were generated by Applied Research Associates (ARA) under the guidance of Dr. Peter Vickery 
and made available to the community through a relationship with the National Institute for Standards and Technology 
(NIST) under the guidance of Dr. Marc Levitan with long-term curation at DesignSafe-CI.

Validation benefitted from special access to ZTRAX data provided by the University of California at Los Angeles 
(UCLA) and the group of Professor Ertugrul Taciroglu.

**Preface**

This documentation is intended to introduce the implementation of the SimCenter's hurricane regional loss modeling 
workflow in the context of Lake Charles, Louisiana under Hurricane Laura. While certain aspects of the workflow 
are unchanged in a given application context, this testbed specifically demonstrates how inventory generation 
capacities and existing heuristic rulesets grounded in codes/standards and normative construction practices in coastal 
communities can be engaged to rapidly generate these loss estimations following a major hurricane. Given the 
significance of the building inventory generation for this testbed, this documentation was written in response to 
two primary audiences/use cases:

**Case 1**: End users who wish to use the testbed to explore specific research questions such as:

#. Observing prevailing patterns in the results to identify specific areas or classes of buildings that were significantly affected.
#. Exploring the potential benefits of various mitigation efforts (changing select attribute assignments and/or damage/loss descriptions in reducing the losses observed in this event).

Such individuals may not wish to generate their own inventories, but require some background in order to meaningfully 
interpret results. This documentation will enhance their understanding of the various assumptions made in generating 
these inventories and assigning the attributes required for the adopted loss models.

**Case 2** Users who wish to use this testbed as a validation event can compare the damage/loss estimates from this 
workflow to direct observations in the field for the purposes of improving/refining the underlying descriptions of 
damage and loss. This can include taking advantage of the data published by the Structural Extreme Event Response 
(StEER) Network, as well as FEMA. Those doing so are advised to:

#. update the heuristic rulesets used for building and attribute assignment to capture the specific regulary 
   environment and construction practices in this region. These detailed rulesets were introduced in the testbed of 
   :ref:`lbl-testbed_Atlantic_City` and are linked as DOIs in DesignSafe; their implementation as Python scripts are 
   available in corresponding links embeded in the documentation.
#. Expand the provided inventory beyond residential construction to encompass other diverse classes of buildings and 
   infrastructure affected by the hurricane (see Section 2.1).
#. Incorporate coastal hazards into the worflow, borrowing the approach developed in the :ref:`lbl-testbed_Atlantic_City` 
   and extend the inventory down into Cameron Parish and other areas significantly impacted by the storm surge.

The revised damage and loss models or extensions to the heuristic rulesets can be contributed back to the SimCenter 
to expand the capabilities of this community software.

Before running this testbed, users are advised to review the Computational Resources Requirements to ensure their 
hardware meets minimum specifications and to understand how to properly estimate the high-performance computing 
resources necessary to execute these testbeds and factors influencing the run time.
