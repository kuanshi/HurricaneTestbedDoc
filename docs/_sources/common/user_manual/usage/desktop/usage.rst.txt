User Guide

The |app|, as will be discussed in :ref:`lblArchitecture`, is a scientific workflow application that creates workflows and runs them in the background. These workflows can involve multiple different backend applications. Once the |app| is started, the user is presented with the user interface shown in |figGenericUI|. It is in this UI where the user selects the applications to run in a workflow, inputs the necessary parameters for each of these applications, starts the workflow either locally or
remotely, and finally views the simulation results. The main window of the UI is divided into several separate areas:

1. Login Button:

The **Login** button is at the top right of the user interface. Before the user can launch any jobs on DesignSafe, they must first login to DesignSafe using their DesignSafe login and password. Pressing the login button will open up the login window for users to enter this information. Users can register for an account on the `DesignSafe-CI <https://www.designsafe-ci.org/account/register>`_ website [#]_. 

2. Input Panel: 

The input panel is the large central area of the user-interface where the user provides input for the various applications, and also where they can view the results. 

3. Input Panel Selection Ribbon: 

The ribbon on the left side provides the user with a selection of buttons to choose from (e.g. **RV: Random Variables**, **RES: Results**). Selecting any of these buttons will change what is displayed in the central input panel. Each panel will present the user with an option for which application to choose for that part of the workflow, and will then allow a user to provide inputs for that application. In the following sections, each of the panels in the input panel selection ribbon are reviewed:

4. Push Buttons:


This is the area near the bottom of the UI in which 4 buttons are contained:

     * **RUN**: Run the simulation locally on the userâ€™s desktop machine.
     * **RUN at DesignSafe**: Process the information, and send to DesignSafe. The simulation will be run there on a supercomputer, and results will be stored in the user's DesignSafe jobs folder.
     * **GET from DesignSafe**: Obtain the list of jobs for the user from DesignSafe and select a job to download from that list.
     * **Exit**: Exit the application.

5. Message Area: 

The message area is located in the bottom of the UI and displays the status and error messages for a running background application. The message area is a dockable dialog which can be resized, moved, and closed as needed. The dialog visibility can be toggled by clicking on the menu item **View** -> **Program Output**. If moved from its default location, the status dialog can be restored to the bottom of the UI by dragging the dialog back to the bottom of the UI and hovering over the area.
