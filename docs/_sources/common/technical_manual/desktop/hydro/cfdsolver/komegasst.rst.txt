k-Omega SST model
===============================

The k-:math:`\omega` Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model was originally proposed by [Me1994]_ as a two-equation eddy-viscosity model. The version available in Hydro-UQ is based on the implementation of [MeKuLa2003]_ which is available through OpenFOAM.

The standard k-:math:`\omega` model is well suited for simulating the flow in the sub-viscous layer while the k-:math:`\epsilon` model is ideal for predicting the flow slightly away from the wall. Further on, the standard k-:math:`\omega` is more suitable for low-Reynolds number flows, highly nonlinear, often sensitive to the initial guess and thus more difficult to converge. 

Alternatively, the k-:math:`\omega` SST is a hybrid model that combines the advantages of the k-:math:`\omega` and k-:math:`\epsilon` models by switching between them. The k-:math:`\omega` SST model uses the k-:math:`\omega` model is used near the wall and switches to the k-:math:`\epsilon` model as it approaches the free-stream. The SST models are generally less sensitive to the free-stream conditions and avoid build-up of excessive turbulent kinetic energy near `stagnation points <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagnation_point>`_ as compared to the usual k-:math:`\epsilon` models.

The governing equations of the k-:math:`\omega` SST model are based on the turbulence kinetic energy :math:`(k)` and the turbulence specific dissipation rate :math:`(\omega)`. They are

- For turbulence kinetic energy :math:`(k)`

    .. math::

        \frac{D}{Dt} \left(\rho k\right) = \nabla \cdot \left( \rho D_k \nabla k \right) + \rho G - \frac{2}{3} \rho k \left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}\right) - \rho \beta^{*} \omega k + S_k

- For turbulence specific dissipation rate :math:`(\omega)`

    .. math::

        \frac{D}{Dt} \left(\rho \omega\right) = \nabla \cdot \left( \rho D_k \nabla \omega \right) + \frac{\rho \gamma G}{\nu} - \frac{2}{3} \rho \gamma \omega \left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}\right) - \rho \beta \omega^2 - \rho \left(F_1 - 1 \right) CD_{k\omega} + S_{\omega}

The turbulence viscosity is obtained as

.. math::

    \nu_t = a_1 \frac{k}{\text{max} \left( a_1, \omega, b_1, F_{23} \right)}
