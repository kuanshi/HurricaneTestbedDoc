The |app| is one of the SimCenter's computational applications, which are `scientific workflow systems <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_workflow_system>`_ that execute a sequence of computational tasks specialized for natural hazard engineering (NHE) problems. In contrast to more general-purpose scientific workflow systems (such as `Taverna <https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/>`_, `Kepler <https://kepler-project.org/>`_, and `Pegasus <https://pegasus.isi.edu/>`_), SimCenter workflow systems include the following features:

   - access to high performance computing resources, available on the cloud through |DesignSafe|, to enable parallel workflows for non-trivial large-scale NHE problems;
   - uncertainty quantification capabilities using `Dakota <https://dakota.sandia.gov/>`_, which allows users to introduce input uncertainties which are propagated through the workflow with random variables;
   - streamlined interfaces between existing software applications and datasets that are widely used by the NHE community, such as `OpenFOAM <https://openfoam.org/>`_, `OpenSees <https://opensees.berkeley.edu/>`_, `ADCIRC <http://adcirc.org/>`_, and `PEER Strong Ground Motion Databases <https://peer.berkeley.edu/peer-strong-ground-motion-databases>`_. To do this, the SimCenter develops pre- and post-processors to these existing applications and utilize web technologies for accessing online services;
   - additional custom software applications produced by the SimCenter. Among these are applications which automate the acquisition of building inventory data (`BRAILS <https://nheri-simcenter.github.io/BRAILS-Documentation/>`_), applications which simulate hazard evens and generate corresponding input files for passing through the workflow system (RegionalEvent Applications), applications for damage and loss assessment (`pelicun <https://nheri-simcenter.github.io/pelicun/>`_), and more.
   - a modular framework which allows developers to incorporate their own software applications as components to the workflow system, so long as it meets the input-output structure at component interfaces.


Documentation of the software architecture is detailed in the following pages:

 Within the natural hazards engineering community, there exists a number of widely used open-source applications, e.g. OpenFOAM, and online datasets, e.g. PEER NGA, that researchers are currently using. As a consequence, and to avoid duplication, SimCenter applications incorprate many of the widely used appliecations, e.g. OpenFOAM. To do this SimCenter develops pre- and post-processors to these existing applications and utilize web-technologies for accessing online services.

   SimCenter Software Framework

The SimCenter scientific workflow systems are aimed at facilitating the use, reuse and extension of common workflows encoutred in NHE by a broad range of natural hazards engineering researchers with varying levels of software skills. In order to encourage this use and adoption, this chapter presents the software architecture for the SimCenter framework and |app| using the `C4 model <https://c4model.com>`_. The **C4** model is graphical approach for documenting software architecture through diagrams that describe and communicate the software architecture at different levels of abstraction. It is a top-down approach which starts at a high level (level 1) showing how a user would interact with the software and drills down through three more levels, with level 4 containing the typical UML diagrams. The choice of the **C4** model was made to provide NHE researchers with a diverse range of software architecture knowledge an understanding of the software architecture behind SimCenter applications that fits their skill level. The four levels:

- Level 1: The level one diagram is a system diagram that shows how the software system fits in the real world in terms of people who use it and other software systems it intercat with.
- Level 2: The level two is a container diagram show the the containers (applications, databases, etc.) that  make up the software system.
- Level 3: Level three diagram are component diagrams, showing how the componets pf the individual containers.
- Level 4: The level four diagrams show how the individual components are implemented. They are typically UML class diagrams.

The following sections present the architecture of SimCenter the SimCenter to level 3:

.. note:: **Definitions**

   #. **Workflow**: “The automation of a business process, in whole or part, during which documents, information or tasks are passed from one participant to another for action, according to a set of procedural rules.” [Workflow Management Coalition].

   #. **Application**: A software application performs operations on data residing in a computer for a user or another program; it can be self contained, typically termed a program, or part of a group of programs.

   #. **Scientific Workflow**: A sequence of steps which propogate input data through a series of applications to produce output. It is a loosely coupled application performing workflows in which each of the coordinated tasks is performed using an individual application. Each of the individual application taking some data inputs and producing data outputs, which are then consumed by subsequent tasks according to the workflow definition. They are termed scientific because they are typically used by scientists to process, manage, and visualize ever increasing ever increasing amounts of data using "scientific" applications. 

   #. **Scientific Workflow System**: An application or applications to aid a user to set-up, schedule, run, and monitor a user defined scientific workflow. 

      #. **Software Framework**: A collection of software for building applications
in a specific domain. The framework defines the interfaces between the components of the software,
provides example applications that can be developed using the provided software, and defines a clear set of interfaces such that the software can be extended to build other applications.

      
Overview
========

A Level 1 diagram showing the system context for the SimCenter applications, i.e. how it fits in the world, is shown in :numref:`figContext`. It shows SimCenter applications (EE-UQ, WE-UQ, PBE, RDT) as a box in the center surrounded by the user and the systems it and the user interact with. The SimCenter applications allows user to create and run scientific workflow applications, the data for the applications may be obtained from the web or DataDepot, the workflow applications are run on either the local desktop or on some HPC at |DesignSafe|.

Given how SimCenter applications fit in with the environment, a level 2 diagrams now demonstrates how the SimCenter applications are broken into high level components. The SimCenter applications are, as shown in :numref:`figContainer`, broken into two components: A front end UI and a back end application that runs the workflow. The front end applications are desktop applications written using the cross-platform `Qt framework <https://www.qt.io/product/framework>`_. The back end is an application that processes the input from the front end, which comes in the form of a JSON file, creates a workflow and runs it. The workflow applications, written in Python, C, or C++, utilize existing applications were possible and run on either the local desktop machine or on a HPC utilizing resources made available to NHE community through DesignSafe.

Two level 3 diagrams are now presented which break up the two containers into the major building blocks or components in C4 terminology. In :numref:`figComponentFront` the component diagram for the front end UI is presented. It outlines the interaction between the user and the individual graphical elements (widgets) of the UI. Given the analogy of a jigsaw puzzle, the user selects which piece of the jigsaw puzzle they are working on in the component selection widget. The widget for the jigsaw piece will then be displayed on the desktop. The user for each jigsaw piece then selects which application to run for that piece, and for the chosen application, they provide the inputs. When the inputs are all provided, the user can select to run the simulations locally or remotely. For jobs that run remotely, the user can download and review previously run simulations. As seen the widgets may subsequently interact with web services through HTTPS requests, or with DesignSafe utilizing TAPIS Restful API through the RemoteService container.

   Component diagram for front end UI.

The component diagram for the backend application shown in :numref:`figComponentBack`, shows that the backend is made up of a number of component applications. The application ``femUQ.py`` is the application that parses the input from the front end, sets up the workflow by creating a ``workflow_driver`` script and then launches the UQ engine. Which UQ Engine and which applications to run in the workflow, is determined from the data passed from the UI and information contained in a file, ``WorkflowApplication.json``. The ``WorkflowApplication.json`` file is a file that maps the applications specified in the output from the UI with a specific application contained on the users local machine or at the remote HPC resource, as such it allow the researchers to modify the applications that may be run in the workflow w/o the need to recompile the application. Once the ``workflow_driver`` file is created, control is passed to a UQ engine, which repeatedly runs the ``workflow_driver`` to generate the results. In running the workflow some of the applications will invoke applications not developed to meet the API. For such applications pre- and post-processors are provided. The figure shows the backend application running locally or remotely on a HPC at DesignSafe.

   Component diagram for Backend Application.

.. note::

   ``femUQ.py`` is the backend application for the EE-UQ, WE-UQ, Hydro-UQ, and the PBE applications. For RDT the backend application is ``RDT_Workflow.py``.

The interaction between the frontend and the backend is best understood by looking at the sequence of events that occurs when the user presses the ``Run`` button. As shown in the figure below, the UI application will first perform a number of steps:

1. It will create a temporary directory in the Documents folder named ``tmp.SimCenter``, and inside ``tmp.SimCenter`` will create another dircetory ``templatedir``.

2. It will then run through all the currently selected widgets and on each invoke the ``copyFiles()`` method, telling these widgets to copy all files that will be needed during the workflow to the ``templatedir`` directory.

3. It will then create a JSON file and will run through the currenly selected widgets and on each invoke the methods ``outputToJSON()`` and ``outputAppDataToJSON``, these telling the application to augment the JSOIN file with the inputs the user has provided in the widget and also the name of the widget.

4. The UI will now start the backend application and will spin until the backend application returns with a completion signal.

Now that the UI has handed over to the backend application, the backend application will perform the following:

5. Open the output file from the UI and parse it to obtain the name of the application to run and the arguments to run the application with. Open up another file, the ``WorkflowApplications.json`` file, contained with the application, to determine given the application name the full path to the executable to be invoked. It will the create in ``templatedir`` a file named ``workflow_driver``. This file is a script file that when run by the UQ engine will generate a file named ``results.out``. ``results.out`` when the ``workflow_driver`` script has completed will contain a single line of space seperated values, one value for each EDP.
   
6.  It will invoke each of the applications with supplied arguments and an additional command line argument, ``--getRV``, to inform the application to process the input file, and to create any additional random variables and input files needed before the workflow runs.

7. It will then launch the UQengine. The UQ engine, is typically a pre- and post- processor to an existing UQ engine.

8. The pre-processor takes the json input file and creates an input file needed by the actual UQ engine.

9. The preprocessor will launch the UQ application. This application will typically run the ``workflow_driver`` many times, passing as input to the workflow a file ``\params`` and obtaining as output from the ``workflow_driver`` a file ``results.out``.

10. When done the engine will output its results.

11. The UQengine will notify the UQpreprocessor that it is done.

12. The UQpreprocessor will notify the femUQ application that it is done.
    
13. The femUQ application will notify the UI that it is done.

14. The UI will read in the reuslts and present them to the user.

   Sequence diagram showing what happens when a Workflow runs Locally


That is for the case where the computations are performed on the local computer. When the somputations are performed remotely the steps are different. The first 8 steps are the same. But now the UQwrapper will not start the UQ engine. Instead, control is returned to the UI. The UI will, as shown in the following: (111) Compress the temporary folder. (12) Send the compressed folder to the remote HPC, shown in the figure DesignSafe. (13) Start an application to perform the computations. All the remote data transfer and application invocation is down through a cloud service, in the figure presented the `TACC tapis <https://tapis-project.org/>`_ interface is being used and provides SimCenter users with access to the TACC HPC resources through DesignSafe portal.
